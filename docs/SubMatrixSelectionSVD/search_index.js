Expressed as fractions of the maximum standard deviation of a variable in X. Should be a vector of increasing values between 0 and 1.\n\nOutputs\n\nU: Pxd matrix of left singular vectors (variable representation).\nS: d-vector of singular values.\nV: Nxd matrix of right singular vectors (sample representation).\nps: d x length(stdThresholds) matrix with all Projection Scores. Useful for plotting.\nsignalDimensions: Vector with the number of dimensions in each signal detected by SMSSVD.\nselectedVariables: For each signal, a bitmask showing the variables selected by Projection Score.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

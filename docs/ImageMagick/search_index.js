See FileIO for further details.It\'s worth pointing out that packages such as Images.jl load FileIO for you.Loading an image is then as simple asimg = load(filename[; view=false])Set view=true to reduce memory consumption when loading large files, possibly at some slight cost in terms of performance of future operations."

Note that version 6.7+ (up to but not including 7.0) are the most supported versions, in particular for multipage TIFFs.  Use ImageMagick.libversion to see what version the installer found.  If ImageMagick.jl doesn\'t find a previous installation, it will install its own copy of the ImageMagick library with Homebrew.jl.ImageMagick.jl 0.3.0 introduced significant improvements in the installation procedure for OSX users. If you\'ve had trouble with previous versions of ImageMagick.jl and attempted to resolve problems manually, some of your workarounds might interfere with the new approach. You can reset your build withusing Homebrew\nHomebrew.rm(\"imagemagick@6\")\nHomebrew.brew(`prune`)\nPkg.build(\"ImageMagick\")You may also find debugging Homebrew useful.Finally, an alternative to ImageMagick on OS X is QuartzImageIO."

You may choose to let the installer add the installation directory to the system path or provide it separately.  In the later case you may add it to your .juliarc.jl file as (for example) push!(Base.DL_LOAD_PATH, \"C:/programs/ImageMagick-6.8.8\"). Alternatively, you can set your MAGICK_HOME environment variable.When manual intervention is necessary, you need to restart Julia for the necessary changes to take effect."

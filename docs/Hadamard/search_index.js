The known Hadamard matrices up to size 256 are currently supported (via a lookup table), along with any size that factorizes into products of these known sizes and/or powers of two.\n\nThe return value is a matrix of Int8 values. If you want to do further matrix computations with this matrix, you may want to convert to Float64 first via float(hadamard(n)).\n\nYou can pretty-print a Hadamard matrix as a table of + and - (indicating the signs of the entries) via Hadamard.printsigns, e.g. Hadamard.printsigns(hadamard(28)) for the 28Ã—28 Hadamard matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

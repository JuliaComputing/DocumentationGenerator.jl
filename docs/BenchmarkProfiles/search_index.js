H[k,p,s] is the k-th costly operation (e.g., function evaluation) for problem p and solver s. Failures on a given problem are represented by a negative value, an infinite value, or NaN.\n\nThe vector N gives a scaling associated to each problem. If the number of simplex gradients is being measured, N[p] should be n(p) + 1 where n(p) is the number of variables of problem p.\n\nThe threshold τ determines the tolerance in the convergence criterion\n\nf(x) ≤ fL + τ (f0 - fL),\n\nwhere for each problem f(x) is a measure recorded (e.g., the objective value), f0 is the measure at the initial point, and fL is the best measure obtained by any solver.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

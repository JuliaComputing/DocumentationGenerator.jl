The method transforms the distribution of the intensities in an image so that they are as uniform as possible [1]. The natural justification for uniformity is that the image has better contrast  if the intensity levels of an image span a wide range on the intensity scale. As it turns out, the necessary transformation is a mapping based on the cumulative histogram.\n\nOne can consider an L-bit single-channel I times J image with gray values in the set 01ldotsL-1 , as a collection of independent and identically distributed random variables. Specifically, let the sample space Omega be the set of all IJ-tuples omega =(omega_11omega_12ldotsomega_1Jomega_21omega_22ldotsomega_2Jomega_I1omega_I2ldotsomega_IJ), where each omega_ij in 01ldots L-1 . Furthermore, impose a probability measure on Omega such that the functions Omega ni omega to omega_ij in 01ldotsL-1 are independent and identically distributed.\n\nOne can then regard an image as a matrix of random variables mathbfG = G_ij(omega), where each function G_ij Omega to mathbbR is defined by\n\nG_ij(omega) = fracomega_ijL-1\n\nand each G_ij is distributed according to some unknown density f_G.

The first argument img is the image to be matched, and the second argument targetimg is the image having the desired histogram to be matched to.\n\nDetails\n\nThe purpose of histogram matching is to transform the intensities in a source image so that the intensities distribute according to the histogram of a specified target image. If one interprets histograms as piecewise-constant models of probability density functions (see build_histogram), then the histogram matching task can be modelled as the problem of transforming one probability distribution into another [1]. It turns out that the solution to this transformation problem involves the cumulative and inverse cumulative distribution functions of the source and target probability density functions.\n\nIn particular, let the random variables x thicksim p_x and z thicksim p_z  represent an intensity in the source and target image respectively, and let\n\n S(x) = int_0^xp_x(w)mathrmd w quad textand quad\n T(z) = int_0^zp_z(w)mathrmd w\n\nrepresent their concomitant cumulative disitribution functions.

These subsets satisfy I_i cap I_j = emptyset forall i neq j, and are commonly referred to as bins. Together they encompass the entire range of data values such that sum_j I_j  =  I . Each bin has width w_j = I_j = a_j+1 - a_j and height h_j which is the constant probability density over the region of the bin.

It differs from ordinary histogram equalization in the respect that the adaptive method computes several histograms, each corresponding to a distinct section of the image, and uses them to redistribute the lightness values of the image. It is therefore suitable for improving the local contrast and enhancing the definitions of edges in each region of an image.\n\nDetails\n\nHistogram equalisation was initially conceived to  improve the contrast in a single-channel grayscale image. The method transforms the distribution of the intensities in an image so that they are as uniform as possible [1]. The natural justification for uniformity is that the image has better contrast  if the intensity levels of an image span a wide range on the intensity scale. As it turns out, the necessary transformation is a mapping based on the cumulative histogram–-see histeq for more details.\n\nA natural extension of histogram equalisation is to apply the contrast enhancement locally rather than globally [2]. Conceptually, one can imagine that the process involves partitioning the image into a grid of rectangular regions and applying histogram equalisation based on the local CDF of each contextual region. However, to smooth the transition of the pixels from one contextual region to another,  the mapping of a pixel is not done soley based on the local CDF of its contextual region. Rather, the mapping of a pixel is a bilinear blend based on the CDF of its contextual region, and the CDFs of the immediate neighbouring regions.\n\nIn adaptive histogram equalisation the image mathbfG is partitioned into P times Q equisized submatrices,\n\nmathbfG =  beginbmatrix\nmathbfG_11  mathbfG_12  ldots  mathbfG_1C \nmathbfG_21  mathbfG_22  ldots  mathbfG_2C \nvdots  vdots  ldots  vdots \nmathbfG_R1  mathbfG_R2  ldots  mathbfG_RC \nendbmatrix\n\nFor each submatrix mathbfG_rc, one computes a concomitant CDF, which we shall denote by T_rc(G_ij). In order to determine which CDFs will be used in the bilinear interpolation step, it is useful to  introduce the function\n\nPhi(mathbfG_rc) = left(  phi_rc  phi_rcright) triangleq left(fracrP2 fraccQ2 right)\n\nand to form the sequences  left(phi_11 phi_21 ldots phi_R1 right) and left(phi_11 phi_12 ldots phi_1C right). For a given pixel G_ij(omega), values of r and c are implicitly defined by the solution to the inequalities\n\nphi_r1 le i le phi_(r+1)1  quad textand  quad  phi_1c le j le phi_1(c+1)\n\nWith r and c appropriately defined, the requisite CDFs are given by\n\nbeginaligned\nT_1(v)   triangleq  T_rc(G_ij) \nT_2(v)   triangleq  T_(r+1)c(G_ij) \nT_3(v)   triangleq  T_(r+1)(c+1)(G_ij) \nT_4(v)   triangleq  T_r(c+1)(G_ij)\nendaligned\n\nFinally, with\n\nbeginaligned\nt   triangleq  fraci - phi_r1phi_(r+1)1 - phi_r1  \nu   triangleq  fracj - phi_1cphi_1(c+1) - phi_1c \nendaligned\n\nthe bilinear interpolated transformation that maps an intensity v at location (ij) in the image to an intensity v is given by [3]\n\nv triangleq barT(v)  = (1-t) (1-u)T_1(G_ij) + t(1-u)T_2(G_ij) + tuT_3(G_ij) +(1-t)uT_4(G_ij)\n\nAn unfortunate side-effect of contrast enhancement is that it has a tendency to amplify the level of noise in an image, especially when the magnitude of the contrast enhancement is very high. The magnitude of contrast enhancement is associated with the gradient of T(cdot), because the  gradient determines the extent to which consecutive input intensities are stretched across the grey-level spectrum. One can diminish the level of noise amplification by limiting the magnitude of the contrast enhancement, that is, by limiting the magnitude of the gradient.\n\nSince the derivative of T(cdot) is the empirical density hatf_G, the slope of the mapping function at any input intensity is proportional to the height of the histogram  hatf_G at that intensity.  Therefore, limiting the slope of the local mapping function is equivalent to clipping the height of the histogram. A detailed description of the  implementation  details of the clipping process can be found in [2].\n\nOptions\n\nVarious options for the parameters of this function are described in more detail below.\n\nChoices for img\n\nThe clahe function can handle a variety of input types. The returned image depends on the input type.

The output is a vector of type HomogeneousPoint storing the sub-pixel coordinates of the corners.\n\nThe algorithm computes a correction factor which is added to the original integer coordinates. In particular, a univariate quadratic polynomial is fit separately to the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of a corner and its immediate east/west, and north/south neighbours. The fit is achieved using a local coordinate system for each corner, where the origin of the coordinate system is a given corner, and its immediate neighbours are assigned coordinates of  minus one and plus one.\n\nThe corner and its two neighbours form a system of three equations. For example, let  x_1 = -1,  x_2 = 0 and  x_3 = 1 denote the local x coordinates of the west, center and east pixels and let the vector mathbfb = r_1 r_2 r_3 denote the corresponding corner response values.

The result is given by x = mathbfA^-1mathbfb.\n\nThe vertex of the quadratic polynomial yields a sub-pixel estimate of the true corner position. For example, for a univariate quadratic polynomial px^2 + qx + r, the x-coordinate of the vertex is frac-q2p. Hence, the refined sub-pixel coordinate is equal to:  c +  frac-q2p, where c is the integer coordinate.\n\nnote: Note\nCorners on the boundary of the image are not refined to sub-pixel precision.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The method transforms the distribution of the intensities in an image so that they are as uniform as possible [1]. The natural justification for uniformity is that the image has better contrast  if the intensity levels of an image span a wide range on the intensity scale. As it turns out, the necessary transformation is a mapping based on the cumulative histogram.\n\nOne can consider an L-bit single-channel I times J image with gray values in the set 01ldotsL-1 , as a collection of independent and identically distributed random variables. Specifically, let the sample space Omega be the set of all IJ-tuples omega =(omega_11omega_12ldotsomega_1Jomega_21omega_22ldotsomega_2Jomega_I1omega_I2ldotsomega_IJ), where each omega_ij in 01ldots L-1 . Furthermore, impose a probability measure on Omega such that the functions Omega ni omega to omega_ij in 01ldotsL-1 are independent and identically distributed.\n\nOne can then regard an image as a matrix of random variables mathbfG = G_ij(omega), where each function G_ij Omega to mathbbR is defined by\n\nG_ij(omega) = fracomega_ijL-1\n\nand each G_ij is distributed according to some unknown density f_G. While f_G is unknown, one can approximate it with a normalised histogram of gray levels,\n\nhatf_G(v)= fracn_vIJ\n\nwhere\n\nn_v = left  left(ij)   G_ij(omega)  = v right  right \n\nrepresents the number of times a gray level with intensity v occurs in mathbfG. To transforming the distribution of the intensities so that they are as uniform as possible one needs to find a mapping T(cdot) such that T(G_ij) thicksim U. The required mapping turns out to be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the empirical density hatf_G,\n\n T(G_ij) = int_0^G_ijhatf_G(w)mathrmd w\n\nOptions\n\nVarious options for the parameters of this function are described in more detail below.\n\nChoices for img\n\nThe histeq function can handle a variety of input types.

The first argument img is the image to be matched, and the second argument oimg is the image having the desired histogram to be matched to.\n\nDetails\n\nThe purpose of histogram matching is to transform the intensities in a source image so that the intensities distribute according to the histogram of a specified target image. If one interprets histograms as piecewise-constant models of probability density functions (see imhist), then the histogram matching task can be modelled as the problem of transforming one probability distribution into another [1].  It turns out that the solution to this transformation problem involves the cumulative and inverse cumulative distribution functions of the source and target probability density functions.\n\nIn particular, let the random variables x thicksim p_x and z thicksim p_z  represent an intensity in the source and target image respectively, and let\n\n S(x) = int_0^xp_x(w)mathrmd w quad textand quad\n T(z) = int_0^zp_z(w)mathrmd w\n\nrepresent their concomitant cumulative disitribution functions.

The returned image is non-zero only at maximal edge locations.\n\nborder is any of the boundary conditions specified in padarray.\n\nIn addition to the maximal edge image, the _subpix versions of these functions also return an estimate of the subpixel location of each local maxima, as a 2D array or image of Graphics.Point objects.  Additionally, each local maxima is adjusted to the estimated value at the subpixel location.\n\nCurrently, the _nonmaxsup functions are identical to the first two function calls, except that they also accept additional keyword arguments.  radius indicates the step size to use when searching in the direction of the gradient; values between 1.2 and 1.5 are suggested (default 1.35).  theta indicates the step size to use when discretizing angles in the gradientangle image, in radians (default: 1 degree in radians = pi/180).\n\nExample:\n\ng = rgb2gray(rgb_image)\ngx, gy = imgradients(g)\nmag, grad_angle = magnitude_phase(gx,gy)\nmag[mag .< 0.5] = 0.0  # Threshold magnitude image\nthinned, subpix =  thin_edges_subpix(mag, grad_angle)\n\n\n\n\n\n"

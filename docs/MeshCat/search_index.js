The overall transform of an object is the composition of the transforms of all of its parents, so setting the transform of vis[:group1] affects the poses of the objects at vis[:group1][:box1] and vis[:group1][:box2].\n\n\n\n\n\n"

For example, GeometryTypes.jl considers the \"origin\" of a cube to be its bottom-left corner, where DrakeVisualizer and MeshCat consider its origin to be the center. The intrinsic_transform(g) returns the transform from the GeometryTypes origin to the MeshCat origin.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
